# Welcome
This is the user guide for blender interchange - a tool for importing data from blender into Unreal Engine 5 as simply as possible. With this tool you can import .blend files by simply dragging and dropping them into the content browser. No more fiddling with export settings and manual export processes. 


# Why Interchange?
Blender Interchange is built on top of Unreal Engine's Interchange framework - which is becoming the new standard for importing content in the engine as of the 5.5 release. 

Interchange is a fully redesigned import flow that allows users to:
- Save pipeline configuration settings as preset pipeline stacks for different workflows
- Apply custom logic at any stage of the import process through blueprint, python or c++,
- Tweak the export process to their current game's needs

You can learn more about interchange by watching epic's [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq6KbrqkGnw) or checking out the [interchange demo project](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/interchange-framework-in-unreal-engine).
